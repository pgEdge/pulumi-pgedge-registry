## 👩‍🏫 Get started

This Pulumi example is written as a template. It is meant to be copied via `pulumi new` as follows:

```bash
pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/aws-ts-containers-dockerbuild
npm install
```

Once copied to your machine, feel free to edit as needed.

## 🎬 How to run

To deploy your infrastructure, run:

```bash
$ pulumi up
# select 'yes' to confirm the expected changes
# wait a bit for everything to get deployed
# ...
# confirm your service is up and running
$ curl $(pulumi stack output url)
# 🎉 Ta-Da!
```

## 🧹 Clean up

To clean up your infrastructure, run:

```bash
$ pulumi destroy
# select 'yes' to confirm the expected changes
